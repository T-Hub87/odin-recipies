<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This lasagna is designed for those busy weeknights where you just
    don't have the time to get an hour of cooking in. It's a simple, 
    elegant dish which maintains all the things you love about a standard
    lasagna recipe, while being less time-intensive and requiring less
    strenuous effort to complete. This is an excellent lasagna, 10/10.
